$(SIGNATURES)

Calculate the direction of arrival of the signal `s` to the manifold `m`. The
calculated DOA is returned as `Spherical` object, where the azimuth is counted
counter-clockwise from the x axis and the elevation is counted from the xy-plane
towards the zenith.

# Arguments:
- `m::AbstractManifold{N}`: Manfiold the signal is received with
- `s::AbstractVector`: Signal subspace for which the doa is estimated
